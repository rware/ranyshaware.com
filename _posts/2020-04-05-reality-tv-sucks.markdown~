Reality TV is trash, but I love it.

Thanks to the COVID-19 and a series of unfortunate events, I'm currently hanging with my parents in a tiny town in upstate NY instead of pretending to work back in Pittsburgh in an apartment all alone.

My parents are avid TLC watchers. I have never watched a show on TLC before, but have of course as a scholar of the Internet and Twitter addict, watched the reactions to these clearly wonderful shows. Nothing seems to illicit more of a strong response from one of my favorite people I follow: [@crissles](https://twitter.com/crissles), than 90 Day Fiance. Yet, I've never taken it upon myself to change the channel to TLC and give this clearly popular show a chance.

Fast forward to tonight. I sit here in my Dad's recliner, in my robe with a blanket, popcorn and soda completely engrossed. A Nigerian man complains about his white lady partner constant white lady complaining. In another scene, a man who mysteriously has no neck massages the feet of a woman he forced to put on a robe. After a commerical break a man with wide eyes, gets in a car and is off to Nigeria. Sorry no, I mean Siberia, whoops. Anywho, I could go on, but I'll stop there since clearly all this TV is melting my precious brain.

Plus, the way my brain is setup, I need to focus while the show is on so that's all I'll say for now.

This has been the smooth sounds of Ray FM. Thanks for coming to my Tedx talk? I wonder if I can add "bad reviews of reality TV shows" to my CV. Comments are welcome.
