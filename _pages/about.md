I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/) at Swarthmore College where I teach systems courses. In my research, I build tools to make evaluating and understanding the Internet and networked systems easier and more accurate.

Previously I was a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow in CMU's [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/). I completed my PhD at CMU also in CSD where I was co-advised by Professor [Justine Sherry](http://justinesherry.com) and Professor [Srinivasan Seshan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/). My thesis was about developing a new methodology for determining if a new congestion control algorithm is safe to deploy in the Internet today.

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://cs.umass.edu) where I worked with Professor [Charles Weems](http://www.cics.umass.edu/~weems/) in the Architecture and Language Implementation Group. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from [The State University of New York at New Paltz](https://www.newpaltz.edu/compsci/). Prior to CMU, I was Associate Technical Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the [Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems Group](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/cyber-analytics-and-decision-systems).

My dissertation won the [SIGCOMM Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.sigcomm.org/awards/sigcomm-doctoral-dissertation-award). In addition, I was a [Facebook Emerging Scholar](https://research.fb.com/programs/emerging-scholars/), a two-time receipient of the [National GEM Consortium Fellowship](http://www.gemfellowship.org/) and was named one of [SUNY New Paltz's 40 under Forty Alumni](http://www.newpaltz.edu/alumni/40underforty/) in 2017.

Here is my [CV](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rware/assets/pdf/ranysha-ware-cv.pdf).
