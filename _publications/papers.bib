abstract = {Much of our understanding of congestion control algorithm (CCA) throughput and fairness is derived from models and measurements that (implicitly) assume congestion occurs in the last mile. That is, these studies evaluated CCAs in "small scale" edge settings at the scale of tens of flows and up to a few hundred Mbps bandwidths. However, recent measurements show that congestion can also occur at the core of the Internet on inter-provider links, where thousands of flows share high bandwidth links. Hence, a natural question is: Does our understanding of CCA throughput and fairness continue to hold at the scale found in the core of the Internet, with 1000s of flows and Gbps bandwidths?Our preliminary experimental study finds that some expectations derived in the edge setting do not hold at scale. For example, using loss rate as a parameter to the Mathis model to estimate TCP NewReno throughput works well in edge settings, but does not provide accurate throughput estimates when thousands of flows compete at high bandwidths. In addition, BBR - which achieves good fairness at the edge when competing solely with other BBR flows - can become very unfair to other BBR flows at the scale of the core of the Internet. In this paper, we discuss these results and others, as well as key implications for future CCA analysis and evaluation.},

 abstract = {The Internet community faces an explosion in new congestion control algorithms
 such as Copa, Sprout, PCC, and BBR. In this paper, we discuss considerations for deploying
 new algorithms on the Internet. While past efforts have focused on achieving ‘fairness’ or
 ‘friendliness’ between new algorithms and deployed algorithms, we instead advocate for an
 approach centered on quantifying and limiting harm caused by the new algorithm on the status quo.
 We argue that a harm-based approach is more practical, more future proof, and handles a wider
 range of quality metrics than traditional notions of fairness and friendliness.}

 abstract = {BBR is a new congestion control algorithm (CCA) deployed for Chromium
 QUIC and the Linux kernel. As the default CCA for YouTube (which
 commands 11+% of Internet traffic), BBR has rapidly become a major
 player in Internet congestion control. BBR’s fairness or friendliness to
 other connections has recently come under scrutiny as measurements
 from multiple research groups have shown undesirable outcomes when
 BBR competes with traditional CCAs. One such outcome is a fixed,
 40% proportion of link capacity consumed by a single BBR flow when
 competing with as many as 16 loss-based algorithms like Cubic or
 Reno. In this short paper, we provide the first model capturing BBR’s
 behavior in competition with loss-based CCAs. Our model is coupled
 with practical experiments to validate its implications. The key
 lesson is this: under competition, BBR becomes window-limited by its
 ‘inflight cap’ which then determines BBR’s bandwidth consumption.
 By modeling the value of BBR’s in-flight cap under varying network
 conditions, we can predict BBR’s throughput when competing against
 Cubic flows with a median error of 5%, and against Reno with amedian of 8%.}
