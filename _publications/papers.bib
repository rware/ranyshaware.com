 abstract = {The Internet community faces an explosion in new congestion control algorithms
 such as Copa, Sprout, PCC, and BBR. In this paper, we discuss considerations for deploying
 new algorithms on the Internet. While past efforts have focused on achieving ‘fairness’ or
 ‘friendliness’ between new algorithms and deployed algorithms, we instead advocate for an
 approach centered on quantifying and limiting harm caused by the new algorithm on the status quo.
 We argue that a harm-based approach is more practical, more future proof, and handles a wider
 range of quality metrics than traditional notions of fairness and friendliness.}

 abstract = {BBR is a new congestion control algorithm (CCA) deployed for Chromium
 QUIC and the Linux kernel. As the default CCA for YouTube (which
 commands 11+% of Internet traffic), BBR has rapidly become a major
 player in Internet congestion control. BBR’s fairness or friendliness to
 other connections has recently come under scrutiny as measurements
 from multiple research groups have shown undesirable outcomes when
 BBR competes with traditional CCAs. One such outcome is a fixed,
 40% proportion of link capacity consumed by a single BBR flow when
 competing with as many as 16 loss-based algorithms like Cubic or
 Reno. In this short paper, we provide the first model capturing BBR’s
 behavior in competition with loss-based CCAs. Our model is coupled
 with practical experiments to validate its implications. The key
 lesson is this: under competition, BBR becomes window-limited by its
 ‘inflight cap’ which then determines BBR’s bandwidth consumption.
 By modeling the value of BBR’s in-flight cap under varying network
 conditions, we can predict BBR’s throughput when competing against
 Cubic flows with a median error of 5%, and against Reno with amedian of 8%.}
